1. Change the background attribute for #div1 to change the background color of div1

2. Changing the margin changes the area outside the border.
   Changing the padding changes the area inside the border.

3. If the margin is greater than 100px, then the <p> element goes outside the box. And the color is no longer visible.
   If the padding is greater than 100px, then the <p> element goes outside the box and the color is still visible.

4. If the overflow is hidden, then the items that go outside the border become hidden.
   If the overflow is scroll, then the entire thing can be seen by scrolling through the box.

5. Float left - puts everything in the same row  aligned to the left in the order 1, 2, 3.
   Float right - puts everything in the same row aligned to the right in the order 3, 2, 1.

6. With div1 - box 1 goes to the left and the other two move to the right.
   With div2 - box 2 goes to the left and one box down. 1 and 3 are aligned to the right vertically.
   With div3 - box 3 goes to the left and one box down. 1 and 2 are aligned to the right horizontally.

7. .div {
	float: left;
   }
   #div3 {
    clear: left;
   }
