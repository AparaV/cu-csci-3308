Snippet 1
=========

1. Bad variable names - needs to be descriptive
2. Hard coded variable paths
3. No documentation
4. No mechanism for handling errors in paths

Snippet 2
=========

1. self.path is not declared
2. Run code in main function
3. Inefficient code.
4. Could use more documentation. I still don't know what this code is supposed to do.
5. Times a bunch of if statements. What should this actually time?
6. Multiple variables are declared on the same line
7. File is opened but never closed.

Snippet 3
=========

1. Hard coded variables
2. More documentation
3. Handle errors

Snippet 4
=========

1. Could use more documentation
2. Handle errors


Peer Review
===========

1. Paths can be encoded as variables for code maintainability and readability
2. Check for errors when pulling data or moving data and store these in a log file
3. Has potentially destructive operations (rm -rf)
